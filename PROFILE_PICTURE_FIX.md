# Profile Picture Bug Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified
You're seeing your friend's profile picture instead of your own in the profile page. This is a common issue that can be caused by:

1. **Cache corruption** - Cached images showing wrong pictures
2. **Data inconsistency** - Mismatch between Firebase Auth and Firestore data
3. **User ID confusion** - Wrong user data being loaded
4. **Image loading errors** - Failed image loads showing cached fallbacks

## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Profile Picture Loading**
- Added better error handling for image loading failures
- Improved cache key generation with time-based refresh
- Added null/empty string checks for photo URLs
- Enhanced image loading error detection

### 2. **Debug Tools Created**
- **`lib/debug_profile_picture.dart`** - Comprehensive debugging screen
- Shows side-by-side comparison of Firestore vs Firebase Auth data
- Displays detailed logs and issue analysis
- Provides cache clearing and data refresh capabilities

### 3. **Profile Data Refresh**
- Added refresh button (🔄) in profile screen header
- Clears image cache and reloads user data
- Forces UI rebuild with fresh data
- Provides user feedback on refresh actions

### 4. **Cache Management**
- Time-based cache keys that refresh every minute
- Manual cache clearing functionality
- Separate cache keys for different data sources
- Error handling for cache operations

## 🧪 How to Debug and Fix

### **Step 1: Use the Debug Screen**
1. Go to your Profile page
2. Tap the **🐛 Debug** button (debug mode only)
3. Check the "Data Comparison" section
4. Look for mismatches between Firestore and Firebase Auth data

### **Step 2: Try the Refresh Button**
1. Go to your Profile page
2. Tap the **🔄 Refresh** button in the top-right
3. This will clear cache and reload your profile data
4. Check if your correct picture appears

### **Step 3: Clear Cache Manually**
1. In the debug screen, tap the **Clear Cache** button
2. This removes all cached profile images
3. Return to profile page to see if issue is resolved

### **Step 4: Check for Data Issues**
The debug screen will show you:
- ✅ **User ID Match**: Auth Provider vs Firebase Auth
- ✅ **Photo URL Match**: Firestore vs Firebase Auth  
- ✅ **Data Consistency**: All profile fields comparison
- ❌ **Issues Found**: Specific problems detected

## 🔍 Common Causes and Solutions

### **Cache Corruption**
- **Symptoms**: Wrong picture showing consistently
- **Solution**: Use refresh button or clear cache in debug screen

### **Data Mismatch**
- **Symptoms**: Different URLs in Firestore vs Firebase Auth
- **Solution**: Update profile picture to sync both sources

### **User ID Confusion**
- **Symptoms**: Completely wrong user data
- **Solution**: Sign out and sign back in

### **Image Loading Failure**
- **Symptoms**: Default avatar or friend's cached image
- **Solution**: Check network connection and retry

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements Made

### **Enhanced Image Loading**:
```dart
CircleAvatar(
  backgroundImage: photoUrl != null && photoUrl.isNotEmpty
      ? CachedNetworkImageProvider(
          photoUrl, 
          cacheKey: 'profile_${userId}_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch ~/ 60000}'
        )
      : null,
  onBackgroundImageError: (exception, stackTrace) {
    debugPrint('Profile image loading error: $exception');
  },
)
```

### **Cache Refresh Function**:
```dart
Future<void> _refreshProfileData() async {
  await user.reload();
  await CachedNetworkImage.evictFromCache(photoUrl);
  setState(() {}); // Force rebuild
}
```
