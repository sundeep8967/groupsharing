### Manually Test the `send-fcm` Supabase Edge Function

This file documents how to manually test the `send-fcm` Supabase Edge Function.

**1. The `curl` Command**

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://groupsharing.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-fcm' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "token": "<A_DEVICE_TOKEN_TO_TEST_WITH>",
  "data": {
    "message": "This is a manual test of the send-fcm function."
  }
}'
```

**2. How to Get the Placeholder Values**

*   **`<YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY>`**: This is your Supabase **`service_role` key**. You can find it in your Supabase project dashboard under **Project Settings > API**. Be very careful with this key, as it bypasses all security policies. Do not expose it publicly.

*   **`<A_DEVICE_TOKEN_TO_TEST_WITH>`**: This is a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token from a device running your app. You'll need to get this from your Flutter application's logs when it starts up on a physical device or emulator/simulator.
