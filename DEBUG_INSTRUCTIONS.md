# Debug Instructions - Get Real-Time Location Logs

## 🔧 **Step 1: Replace Your Location Provider**

1. **Backup your current provider** (rename `lib/providers/location_provider.dart` to `lib/providers/location_provider_backup.dart`)

2. **Rename the debug provider** (rename `lib/providers/location_provider_debug.dart` to `lib/providers/location_provider.dart`)

3. **Run your app again** with `flutter run`

## 📱 **Step 2: Test and Get Logs**

1. **Open your app**
2. **Toggle location sharing ON**
3. **Wait 10 seconds**
4. **Toggle location sharing OFF**
5. **Wait 10 seconds**
6. **Toggle location sharing ON again**

## 📋 **Step 3: Copy the Console Output**

Look for lines in your console that start with:
```
LOCATION_PROVIDER_DEBUG:
```

These will show you exactly what's happening. Copy ALL of these lines and share them.

## 🔍 **What the Debug Logs Will Show:**

- ✅ When the provider initializes
- ✅ When Firebase listeners are set up
- ✅ When Firebase snapshots are received
- ✅ How many users are sharing location
- ✅ What location data is found
- ✅ When the UI is updated
- ❌ Any errors that occur

## 🚨 **If You Don't See Debug Logs:**

If you don't see any `LOCATION_PROVIDER_DEBUG:` lines in your console, it means:

1. **The provider isn't being used** - Check if you're using Provider in your main.dart
2. **Flutter logs are filtered** - Try running with `flutter run --verbose`
3. **The provider isn't initializing** - There might be an authentication issue

## 📊 **Alternative: Check Firebase Console**

While testing, also check your Firebase Console:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Open your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Look at the `users` collection
5. See if documents actually change when you toggle

## 🎯 **What I Need:**

Please share:
1. **All console output** that contains `LOCATION_PROVIDER_DEBUG:`
2. **Whether you see changes** in Firebase Console
3. **Any error messages** you see

This will tell us exactly where the real-time updates are failing!
