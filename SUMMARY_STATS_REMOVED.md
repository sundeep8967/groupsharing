# Summary Statistics Removed - Complete

## Change Summary
Successfully removed the summary statistics card (Total, Family, Friends numbers) from the "All" tab in the friends screen, creating a cleaner and less cluttered interface.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Summary Statistics Card
- **Total count**: Removed total friends number display
- **Family count**: Removed family members count in stats
- **Friends count**: Removed friends count in stats

## Current Interface

### "All" Tab (After Changes)
```
┌─ Family Section ─┐
│ Family (X)       │ ← Only section headers show counts

└─────────────────┘

┌─ Friends Section ─┐
│ Friends (Y)       │ ← Only section headers show counts
