  print('üîß Testing Friend Address Display Fix');
  print('====================================');
  
  print('‚úÖ FIXED: Friend address visibility issues');
  print('   - Now checks BOTH current location AND last known location');
  print('   - Uses current location from LocationProvider if available');
  print('   - Falls back to friend.lastLocation if current not available');
  print('   - Improved cache key to include coordinates for accuracy');
  print('   - Added widget update detection to reload address when location changes');
  print('   - Better error handling and user feedback');
  
  print('\nüìã Changes Made:');
  print('   1. Enhanced location detection logic:');
  print('      - Check locationProvider.userLocations[friendId] first');
  print('      - Fall back to friend.lastLocation if not found');
  print('      - Use whichever location is available');
  
  print('\n   2. Improved caching system:');
  print('      - Cache key now includes coordinates: "friendId_lat_lng"');
  print('      - Prevents stale address data for different locations');
  print('      - More accurate cache hits');
  
  print('\n   3. Added lifecycle management:');
  print('      - didUpdateWidget() detects friend data changes');
  print('      - Automatically reloads address when location updates');
  print('      - Ensures address stays in sync with location');
  
  print('\n   4. Better user feedback:');
  print('      - "No location data available" instead of generic message');
  print('      - Clear loading states with progress indicators');
  print('      - Proper error handling for address resolution');
  
  print('\nüéØ Expected Results:');
  print('   - Friends with last known location will show their address');
  print('   - Address updates when friend location changes');
  print('   - No more missing addresses for friends with location data');
  print('   - Proper fallback to last known location when current unavailable');
  
  print('\nüìç Address Display Priority:');
  print('   1. Current real-time location (if friend is sharing)');
  print('   2. Last known location from friend profile');
  print('   3. "No location data available" if neither exists');
  
  print('\n‚ú® Friends should now show their last known address! üéâ');
