## 🎯 **Why This Happens**

Android manufacturers add aggressive battery optimization to improve battery life, but this kills background apps like location sharing. Each manufacturer has different settings, which is why there are so many steps.

**The key is that ALL these settings must be configured correctly - missing even one can cause the background location to stop working.**

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Always restart** your device after changing these settings
2. **Test thoroughly** - put app in background for at least 5 minutes
3. **Check regularly** - some updates can reset these settings
4. **Use the diagnostic tool** in Profile > Settings > Fix Background Location

**Your background location WILL work if you follow these steps correctly!** 🚀
