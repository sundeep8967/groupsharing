- **Service Status**: Real-time status of all integrated services

### 4. **Monitor Real-time Updates**

The Live Logs tab now shows:
- Location provider state changes
- Service initialization results
- Real-time location updates
- Error detection and recovery
- Performance metrics

## API Usage

### Start Debug Session with Integration

```dart
// Get location providers from context
final locationProvider = Provider.of<LocationProvider>(context, listen: false);
final enhancedLocationProvider = Provider.of<EnhancedLocationProvider>(context, listen: false);
final authProvider = Provider.of<AuthProvider>(context, listen: false);

// Start debugging with full integration
await BackgroundLocationDebugService.startDebugging(
  userId: authProvider.user?.uid,
  locationProvider: locationProvider,
  enhancedLocationProvider: enhancedLocationProvider,
);
```

### Test All Location Services

```dart
await BackgroundLocationDebugService.testLocationServices(
  locationProvider: locationProvider,
  enhancedLocationProvider: enhancedLocationProvider,
  userId: userId,
);
```

### Get Device-Specific Recommendations

```dart
final recommendations = await BackgroundLocationDebugService.getLocationServiceRecommendations();

print('Recommended Service: ${recommendations['recommended']}');
print('Reason: ${recommendations['reason']}');
print('Recommended Provider: ${recommendations['provider']['primary']}');
```

### Restart with Optimal Configuration

```dart
await BackgroundLocationDebugService.restartWithRecommendedConfiguration(
  locationProvider: locationProvider,
  enhancedLocationProvider: enhancedLocationProvider,
  userId: userId,

## Advanced Integration Features

### Custom Service Integration

You can extend the integration to include custom location services:

```dart
// Add custom service diagnostics
static Future<void> _diagnoseCustomLocationService() async {
  try {
    _log('üîß CustomLocationService Status:');
    
    final initialized = await CustomLocationService.initialize();
    _log('   Initialization: ${initialized ? "‚úÖ Success" : "‚ùå Failed"}');
    
    if (!initialized) {
      _log('‚ùå CustomLocationService failed to initialize!', isError: true);
    }
    
  } catch (e) {
    _log('‚ùå Error checking CustomLocationService: $e', isError: true);
  }
}
```

### Custom Provider Monitoring

Add monitoring for custom location providers:

```dart
// Monitor custom provider changes
if (customProvider != null) {
  customProvider.addListener(() {
    _log('üîß CustomProvider Update:');
    _log('   Status: ${customProvider.status}');
    _log('   Location: ${customProvider.currentLocation}');
    
    if (customProvider.error != null) {
      _log('‚ùå CustomProvider error: ${customProvider.error}', isError: true);
    }
  });
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Debug service uses minimal memory overhead
- Logs are automatically managed and cleaned up
- Stream subscriptions are properly disposed

### CPU Impact
- Periodic checks run every 10 seconds by default
- Monitoring has negligible CPU impact
- Background processing is optimized for efficiency

### Battery Impact
- Debug service itself has minimal battery impact
- Helps optimize location services for better battery life
- Identifies and resolves battery-draining issues

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Machine learning-based service optimization
- Predictive failure detection
- Cloud-based device compatibility database
- Real-time collaboration with support teams
- Integration with crash reporting services

### Extensibility
