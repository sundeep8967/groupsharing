// Mock FirebaseService static methods - This is tricky.

// or pass FirebaseService as a dependency to AuthService.
// For now, we'll assume we might need to refactor AuthService to inject FirebaseService,
// or we create a test-specific FirebaseService that doesn't make real calls.
// A simpler approach for now, if AuthService directly calls static methods,
// is to acknowledge this limitation and focus on what can be mocked (FirebaseAuth, GoogleSignIn).
// If FirebaseService itself was an instance passed to AuthService, we could mock it.

// Let's assume FirebaseService static methods will be called as is, and we test around them,
// or we handle their mocking when we get to FirebaseService tests by other means.
// For AuthService tests, we are more concerned with its interaction with FirebaseAuth.

void main() {
  group('AuthService', () {
    late AuthService authService;
    late MockFirebaseAuth mockFirebaseAuth;
    late MockGoogleSignIn mockGoogleSignIn;
    // We would also need a MockFirebaseService if AuthService took it as a dependency.
    // For now, FirebaseService.deleteUserDocument and .deleteUserSubCollections are static.

    setUp(() {
      mockFirebaseAuth = MockFirebaseAuth();
      mockGoogleSignIn = MockGoogleSignIn();
      // To make AuthService testable with mocks for FirebaseService,
      // AuthService would need to accept FirebaseService as a dependency.
      // e.g., AuthService(this._auth, this._googleSignIn, this._firebaseService)
      // For now, we are testing AuthService as is.
      authService = AuthService(); // This will use the real FirebaseService.auth and .firestore
                                   // which is not ideal for unit testing deleteUserAccount's dependencies on FirebaseService.

      // We need to be able to inject the mockFirebaseAuth into AuthService.
      // The current AuthService structure (AuthService._auth = FirebaseService.auth) makes this hard.
      // A common pattern is to allow injecting FirebaseAuth for testing:
      // AuthService({FirebaseAuth? auth, GoogleSignIn? googleSignIn})
      //   : _auth = auth ?? FirebaseAuth.instance,
      //     _googleSignIn = googleSignIn ?? GoogleSignIn();

        // For now, I'll write the expectation.
        // authService = AuthService(auth: mockFirebaseAuth, googleSignIn: mockGoogleSignIn); // Assumed refactor

        // How to proceed:
        // 1. AuthService needs to be refactored to accept FirebaseAuth, GoogleSignIn.
        // 2. FirebaseService.deleteUserDocument and .deleteUserSubCollections are static and cannot be directly mocked
        //    without a more advanced mocking framework or refactoring FirebaseService to be injectable.

        // Given the constraints, I will focus on testing the logic within deleteUserAccount
        // that *can* be controlled by the mocks I *can* create (User, FirebaseAuthException).
        // The calls to the static FirebaseService methods will be assumed to work or fail as part of the test setup if possible.

        // If AuthService is not refactored, I cannot truly unit test this part of deleteUserAccount
        // in isolation from the static FirebaseService.auth.
        // I will proceed with writing the test structure and highlight where refactoring would be needed.

        final authServiceInstance = AuthService(); // Uses real Firebase.auth
        // To test "no user":
        // One option: ensure firebase_auth.FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser is null in test setup.
        // This is hard without a test runner environment that can clear auth state.

        // For now, let's assume we can set the current user on our mock.
        // The following expect will likely fail if AuthService cannot use the mock.
        // expect(authServiceInstance.deleteUserAccount(), throwsA(isA<Exception>()));
        // This test will be more of a placeholder due to architectural constraints for mocking.

        // This test setup assumes AuthService can be instantiated with mockFirebaseAuth and mockGoogleSignIn.
        // And that FirebaseService.deleteUserDocument / deleteUserSubCollections can be "mocked"
        // perhaps by setting up a test Firebase environment or using a mocking framework that handles static methods.
        // Since that's not available, this test is also more of a conceptual outline.

        // authService = AuthService(auth: mockFirebaseAuth, googleSignIn: mockGoogleSignIn);

        // We need a way to verify calls to static FirebaseService.deleteUserDocument and .deleteUserSubCollections.
        // This is a common pain point with static service locators/methods.

        // verify(mockFirebaseService.deleteUserSubCollections('test_uid')).called(1);
        // verify(mockFirebaseService.deleteUserDocument('test_uid')).called(1);
        // verify(mockUser.delete()).called(1);

**Reflections on `AuthService` and `FirebaseService` for Testability:**

The current static nature of `FirebaseService.auth`, `FirebaseService.firestore` and the service methods like `FirebaseService.deleteUserDocument` makes `AuthService` and `FirebaseService` themselves hard to unit test in isolation.

*   **`AuthService`**: Should ideally take `FirebaseAuth`, `GoogleSignIn`, and an instance of `FirebaseService` as constructor parameters. This allows injecting mocks for all its dependencies.
*   **`FirebaseService`**: If it were an instantiable class (e.g., `FirebaseServiceImpl implements FirebaseService`), its methods like `deleteUserDocument` would be instance methods. Then, `AuthService` could depend on the `FirebaseService` interface, and we could provide a `MockFirebaseService` in tests.

Without these refactors, writing true unit tests that mock out *all* external dependencies for `deleteUserAccount` is very challenging. The tests above are structured with these ideal refactors in mind but acknowledge the current limitations.

Given the tool limitations (no `flutter pub get` success, thus no `build_runner` for proper mockito generation), and the architectural constraints, I will:
1.  Continue to write the *structure* of the tests and manual mocks.
2.  Focus on testing the parts that *can* be tested with simple manual mocks (e.g., logic within a method if its direct inputs can be mocked).
3.  For interactions with static methods or unmockable dependencies, I will note this in the tests or the summary.

Let's proceed to create `test/services/firebase_service_test.dart`.
