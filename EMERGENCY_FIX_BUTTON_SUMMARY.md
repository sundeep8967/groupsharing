bool _isLocationSharingWorking() {
  // Check various location sharing conditions
  return isWorking;
}

// UI integration
EmergencyFixButton(
  showButton: !_isLocationSharingWorking(),
)
```

### **Animation System:**
```dart
// Pulsing animation
AnimationController _pulseController;
Animation<double> _pulseAnimation;
