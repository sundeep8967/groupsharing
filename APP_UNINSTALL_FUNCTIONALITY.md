# App Uninstall Functionality Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive app uninstall detection system that ensures users appear offline to their friends when they uninstall the app.

## Overview

When a user uninstalls the app, they should immediately appear as **offline** to all their friends. The system uses multiple mechanisms to detect app uninstallation and ensure proper cleanup of user data.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. App Lifecycle Monitoring
- **Real-time detection** of app termination using `WidgetsBindingObserver`
- **Automatic cleanup** when app is being terminated
- **State preservation** during normal app lifecycle events

### 2. Heartbeat Mechanism
- **Periodic heartbeat signals** sent every 30 seconds while app is active
- **Automatic detection** when heartbeats stop for 2+ minutes (indicating app uninstall)
- **Real-time monitoring** by friends to identify inactive users
- **Stale heartbeat detection** marks users offline automatically

### 3. Immediate Cleanup
- **Database cleanup** when app termination is detected
- **Location data removal** from all sharing databases
- **Status flags** to indicate app uninstallation

### 4. Friend Notification
- **Real-time updates** to friends about uninstall status
- **Immediate offline appearance** when app is uninstalled
- **Clear distinction** between temporary offline and app uninstall

## üîß Technical Implementation

### App Lifecycle Management

#### Enhanced MyApp Class
```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  LocationProvider? _locationProvider;

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    switch (state) {
      case AppLifecycleState.detached:
        // App is being terminated - clean up user data
        _handleAppTermination();
        break;
      // ... other states
    }
  }

  void _handleAppTermination() {
    debugPrint('=== APP TERMINATION DETECTED ===');
    _locationProvider?.cleanupUserData();
  }
}
```

### Heartbeat System

#### Heartbeat Timer
```dart
// Heartbeat mechanism to detect app uninstall
Timer? _heartbeatTimer;
static const Duration _heartbeatInterval = Duration(minutes: 2);

void _startHeartbeat(String userId) {
  _heartbeatTimer = Timer.periodic(_heartbeatInterval, (timer) {
    if (_mounted && _isTracking) {
      _sendHeartbeat(userId);
    } else {
      timer.cancel();
    }
  });
}
```

#### Heartbeat Signal
```dart
Future<void> _sendHeartbeat(String userId) async {
  // Update heartbeat in Realtime Database
  await _realtimeDb.ref('users/$userId/lastHeartbeat').set(ServerValue.timestamp);
  
  // Update heartbeat in Firestore
  await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').doc(userId).update({
    'lastHeartbeat': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    'appUninstalled': false,
  });
}
```

### Cleanup Mechanisms

#### App Termination Cleanup
```dart
Future<void> cleanupUserData() async {
  final userId = await _getCurrentUserId();
  if (userId != null) {
    // Mark user as offline and clear all location data
    await _markUserAsOfflineForUninstall(userId);
    
    // Clear local preferences
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.clear();
  }
}
```

#### Uninstall-Specific Offline Marking
```dart
Future<void> _markUserAsOfflineForUninstall(String userId) async {
  // Remove from Realtime Database locations
  await _realtimeDb.ref('locations/$userId').remove();
  
  // Update status to indicate app uninstallation
  await _realtimeDb.ref('users/$userId').update({
    'locationSharingEnabled': false,
    'appUninstalled': true,
    'lastSeen': ServerValue.timestamp,
    'appLastActive': ServerValue.timestamp,
  });
  
  // Update Firestore with uninstall status
  await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').doc(userId).update({
    'locationSharingEnabled': false,
    'appUninstalled': true,
    'location': null,
    'lastSeen': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    'appLastActive': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  });
}
```

### Friend Detection System

#### Enhanced Status Listener
```dart
void _listenToAllUsersStatus() {
  _realtimeDb.ref('users').onValue.listen((event) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Check if app was uninstalled
    final appUninstalled = userData['appUninstalled'] == true;
    final isSharing = userData['locationSharingEnabled'] == true && !appUninstalled;
    
    if (appUninstalled) {
      _log('User ${userId.substring(0, 8)} app was uninstalled - marking as offline');
      // Remove from locations as well
      _userLocations.remove(userId);
    }
  });
}
```

## üìä Database Structure

### Realtime Database
```json
{
  "users": {
    "userId": {
      "locationSharingEnabled": false,
      "appUninstalled": true,
      "lastSeen": "timestamp",
      "appLastActive": "timestamp",
      "lastHeartbeat": "timestamp"
    }
  },
  "locations": {
    // User removed when app uninstalled - no entry
  }
}
```

### Firestore
```json
{
  "users": {
    "userId": {
      "locationSharingEnabled": false,
      "appUninstalled": true,
      "location": null,
      "lastSeen": "timestamp",
      "appLastActive": "timestamp",
      "lastHeartbeat": "timestamp"
    }
  }
}
```

## üéÆ User Experience Flow

### Scenario: User Uninstalls App

1. **App Termination Detection**: App lifecycle observer detects termination
2. **Immediate Cleanup**: User data is cleaned up from databases
3. **Heartbeat Stops**: No more heartbeat signals are sent
4. **Friend Notification**: Friends see user disappear from map immediately
5. **Offline Status**: User is marked with `appUninstalled: true` flag

### Scenario: Friend's Perspective

1. **Real-time Update**: Sees friend disappear from map instantly
2. **Clear Status**: Friend is marked as offline due to app uninstall
3. **Heartbeat Monitoring**: System detects missing heartbeats
4. **Permanent Offline**: User stays offline until app is reinstalled

### Scenario: User Reinstalls App

1. **Fresh Start**: App starts with clean state
2. **New Authentication**: User signs in again
3. **Status Reset**: `appUninstalled` flag is cleared
4. **Online Again**: User appears online to friends when tracking starts
