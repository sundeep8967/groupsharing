# Notification Text Visibility Fix - Complete

## Problem Analysis
The user reported that **notification texts are not visible** because they were set to white color, making them invisible on light-colored backgrounds.

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was in the `_showSnackBar` method in `lib/screens/friends/friends_family_screen.dart`. The text and icon colors were hardcoded to white:

```dart
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
Icon(icon, color: Colors.white, size: 20),
Text(message, style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white))
```

This caused text to be invisible when the SnackBar background was light-colored (like blue, orange, or grey).

## Solution Implemented

### **Dynamic Color Calculation**
```dart
// BEFORE (Hardcoded white)
Icon(icon, color: Colors.white, size: 20),
Text(message, style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white))

// AFTER (Dynamic based on background)
final brightness = ThemeData.estimateBrightnessForColor(color);
final textColor = brightness == Brightness.dark ? Colors.white : Colors.black87;
final iconColor = brightness == Brightness.dark ? Colors.white : Colors.black87;

Icon(icon, color: iconColor, size: 20),
Text(message, style: TextStyle(
  color: textColor,
  fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
))
```

### **Automatic Text Color Logic**
The system now automatically determines the best text color based on background brightness:

1. **Dark backgrounds** (green, red, dark blue) â†’ **White text & icons**
2. **Light backgrounds** (grey, light blue, orange) â†’ **Black text & icons**

### **Enhanced Text Styling**
- Added `fontWeight: FontWeight.w500` for better text visibility
- Consistent icon and text color pairing
- Optimal contrast for all background colors

## Color Combinations Fixed

| Background Color | Brightness | Text Color | Icon Color | Visibility |
|------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Green** (success) | Dark | White | White | âœ… Excellent |
| **Blue** (info) | Medium | White | White | âœ… Excellent |
| **Orange** (warning) | Light | Black | Black | âœ… Excellent |
| **Grey** (neutral) | Light | Black | Black | âœ… Excellent |
| **Red** (error) | Dark | White | White | âœ… Excellent |

## Technical Implementation

### **Brightness Detection**
```dart
final brightness = ThemeData.estimateBrightnessForColor(color);
```
Uses Flutter's built-in brightness estimation to determine if a color is perceived as light or dark.

### **Adaptive Color Selection**
```dart
final textColor = brightness == Brightness.dark ? Colors.white : Colors.black87;
final iconColor = brightness == Brightness.dark ? Colors.white : Colors.black87;
```
Automatically selects the appropriate contrast color for optimal readability.

### **Enhanced Typography**
```dart
style: TextStyle(
  color: textColor,
  fontWeight: FontWeight.w500, // Better visibility
),
```
Added medium font weight for improved text clarity and readability.
